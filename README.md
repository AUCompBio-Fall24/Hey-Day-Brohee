# Let's celebrate Hey Day!
HEY to my all beloved friends!
Join me in celebrating "Hey Day" at Auburn Univeristy at 16 th October! "Hey Day" is one of Auburnâ€™s most unique traditions. It provides an opportunity for new and current students to introduce themselves to one another. Hey Day is a beloved tradition at Auburn University that began in 1947 to create a welcoming environment for returning World War II soldiers.
