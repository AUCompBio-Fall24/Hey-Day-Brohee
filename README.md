# Hey Day Invitation
Join me in celebrating **"Hey Day"** at **Auburn Univeristy** on this **Wednedsay** at **16 th October**! **"Hey Day"** is one of Auburnâ€™s most unique traditions. It provides an opportunity for new and current students to introduce themselves to one another. Hey Day is a beloved tradition at Auburn University that began in 1947 to create a welcoming environment for returning World War II soldiers.
